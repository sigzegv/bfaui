# BFA UI for wow tbc (2.4.3)

This is an implementation of the BFA UI for wow tbc.
The addon is a rewrite of BattleForAzerothUI_Classic. (You can find it at http://https://github.com/EsreverWoW/BattleForAzerothUI_Classic )

This addon uses original wow UI actions bar and micro menu elements, it does not create any new UI elements.
It just changes background texture for these elements.
